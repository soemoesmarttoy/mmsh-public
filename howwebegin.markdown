Light Weight ERP - the first web application that was created by MMSH.

MMSH was founded to distribute and enhance it.

We want to talk a little bit about ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) first.

ERP is the software that is used by manufacturers to manage their finances and inventories.

Raw products that were on-hands are automatically consumed depending on the finished products that are produced. The system keeps track of quantities and values of all products. The users can know exactly how much quantites they have for each product in real time without needing to calculate and can effectively manage products for further operations/processes.

If we have to record all data regarding to production, we may make mistakes, we may take time and hence we may cost more money and un-systematic rather than using ERP Software. Many companies from all over the world widely reap the benefits of using ERP Software.
